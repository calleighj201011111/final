<td>“'Antarctica is the world’s last great wilderness. We have a unique opportunity to prevent some of the widespread environmental problems that have occurred elsewhere and chart a new course for our relationship with nature – one where we safeguard ourselves by safeguarding the natural systems that make life on earth possible.'
Claire Christian, Executive Director" (offical quote from website)</td>
<td>"To prevent mass extinctions, maintain ecosystem function and address climate change, at least 30 percent of the world’s ocean must be protected by 2030. Simultaneously, the entire ocean must be sustainably managed to support growing populations and economies, maintain food security and preserve the livelihoods and culture of coastal communities."

There was a time decades ago when American fisheries were overfished and unsustainable. But a little-known environmental law changed all this, leading to one of America’s greatest comeback stories.
The Magnuson-Stevens Act is not exactly a household name. But over the past four decades, it has been responsible for a remarkable comeback in U.S. fisheries: from overfished federal disaster zones to some of the best managed natural resources in the world. Now, MSA serves as a legislative success that everyone should know about."(official quote from webite)</td>
